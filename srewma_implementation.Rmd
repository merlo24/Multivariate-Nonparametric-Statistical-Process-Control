```

## Synopsis

In any industry, quality of a process is determined by their capacity to generate products/services that met the requirements established by the consumers. To meet these specifications multivariate statistical process control (MSPC), through control charts, evaluates a multivariate process quality by monitoring its underlying distribution in real-time, the purpose of this is to detect as soon as possible any potential mean or scale shift attributed to special causes.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
