## Synopsis

In any industry, quality of a process is determined by their capacity to
generate products/services that met the requirements established by the
consumers. To meet these specifications multivariate statistical process
control (MSPC), through control charts, evaluates a multivariate process
quality by monitoring its underlying distribution in real-time, the
purpose of this is to detect as soon as possible any potential mean or
scale shift attributed to special causes.

Although the traditional Hotellingâ€™s *T*<sup>2</sup> is the most common
control chart in MSPC, it is built under the assumption that process
follows a multivariate normal distribution. Nevertheless, it is well
known that in practice this assumption is rarely fulfilled because of
the process often following an unknown distribution.

Therefore multivariate nonparametric approaches such as the Signed Rank
Exponentially Weighted Average (SREWMA) control chart **(cita)** can be
considered as an efficient alternative that allows the monitoring of
processes for which no known distribution is assumed. In this document
we discuss the implementation of SREWMA Control Chart.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
