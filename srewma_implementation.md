## Synopsis

In any industry, quality of a process is determined by their capacity to
generate products/services that met the requirements established by the
consumers. To meet these specifications multivariate statistical process
control (MSPC), through control charts, evaluates a multivariate process
quality by monitoring its underlying distribution in real-time, the
purpose of this is to detect as soon as possible any potential mean or
scale shift attributed to special causes.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
